# Interactive heatmaps
I built this project for the People Analytics team at Genentech. The purpose was to create a customizable template that non-Python programmers could use to build interactive heatmaps. The interactive heatmaps I built using DASH for plotly includes an employee count at Genentech by division and salary band, and the % of managers by division and salary band. I developed the visualizations in such a way that they could be easily interpreted by non-data scientists on the People Analytics team. 

# Usage
The dataset I worked with is not included because it is proprietary to the company. 

However, you can customize and run cleaning.py to clean your dataset. You can customize and run customize_graphs.py to customize the color, layout, type of interactive visualization, etc. This code will output two interactive heatmaps that you can view in a web application.
